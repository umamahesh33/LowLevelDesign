Strategy Pattern
I1 I2
S1 S2

NumStore class where i collect numbers by supporting these two functions insert and search

lets say i'll have a check insert(int num, InsertionType)
then i can check insertionType with if else statements and call the respective implementation
Factory need to be implemented
but here i have a dependncy on method levels

basically double abstract interfaces

Insertion Interface - I1impl I2impl
Search Interface - S1impl S2impl

insert(int num, InsertionFactory)
    insertFactory.insert(num)

search(int num, SearchFactory)
    searchFactory.search(num)
